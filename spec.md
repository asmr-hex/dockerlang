# How to use Dockerlang

H e l l o and welcome, you've made it: you're in Dockerlang, a dockerland where everything is docker.
Let us begin! by creating a dockerlang file! The file extension is `.doc`.

## Hello, wirld

To print text in Dockerlang, all you have to do is use the `#` symbol, which means printing, followed with the location to print to.
If you want to print to standard out, use `!`, or to print to a string, put a string after the `#`.

```dockerlang
< code sample >
```

## (In)variables

Variables in Dockerlang are called `variable`s, and constants are `invaliable`s. Here's how to declare a variable!
```dockerlang
< code sample >
```

Dockerlang doesn't worry about types and neither should you. Be free.

## Control structures
